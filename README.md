# 📌 Face Recognition Attendance System

A real-time **Face Recognition Based Attendance System** built using **Python** and **OpenCV**, designed to automate attendance marking by detecting and recognizing faces through a camera feed. The system supports **new user registration**, **dataset creation**, and **attendance logging** with timestamp storage.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **User Registration**
   - Captures multiple face images of a new user.
   - Stores them in a dataset directory.

2. **Model / Encoding Creation**
   - Generates face encodings for all stored faces.

3. **Real-Time Recognition**
   - Opens webcam feed.
   - Detects faces and compares encodings.

4. **Attendance Marking**
   - Marks recognized person’s attendance.
   - Saves name + timestamp in an attendance file.
